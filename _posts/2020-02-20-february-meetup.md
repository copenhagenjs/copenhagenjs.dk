# CopenhagenJS February - DFDS

Hi everyone!

First CopenhagenJS of the year and this time we are going to be at DFDS.

A new year of JavaScript and already so many cool things have happened. Microsoft Edge is out of preview and Microsoft has changed a lot of things about the browser, it is not just a Chrome with a new skin.
New stuff is also happening with ES modules, like https://www.snowpack.dev that allows you to build webapps with no bundler! Gatsby.js and Next.js are continuing developing strongly https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-2

So come and join us and talk about JavaScript 😀

## What is CopenhagenJS?

CopenhagenJS is a community group in Copenhagen for all JavaScript developers. We get together and share things we work on and really like. We talk about various technologies that we either use on a day to day basis or aspire to use.

## Can I present something at CopenhagenJS?

Definitely, CopenhagenJS is for and by the community, so you are more than welcome to talk about things that you find interesting and we will assist you with your speaking if you are new or have any difficulties. You can contact us with a private message or comment here on meetup.com, or on any social network where you can find us.
