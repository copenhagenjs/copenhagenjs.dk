This meetup will be held at the One.com office, which is just south of the
central station. This time we have 3 really promising javascript talks.

The creator of the [jspm package manager](http://jspm.io/)j and
[systemjs](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) is visting Copenhagen and will
give a talk.

Come join us for a nice evening in the company of other JavaScript enthusiasts.
