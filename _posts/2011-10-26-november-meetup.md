We are pleased to announce the November CopenhagenJS meetup. Clear your schedule for Thursday, as we will once again meet and talk JavaScript and all things frontend.

**November 17th 2011 at 19.00**.

## Agenda

* Robert Krahn: "Lively Kernel - A Development Environment for Creating and Sharing Rich Web Applications"
* Morten Nobel-Jørgensen : [KickJS](https://github.com/mortennobel/KickJS) - A WebGL game engine for modern web-browsers
* Morgan Roderick: "Closures, this, call and apply — an attempt at an explanation"

We could still use a speaker or two, so if you have something to share, a cool project to show off, do drop us a note at <hello@copenhagenjs.dk> and tell us about your topic, and we will try to fit you in.
