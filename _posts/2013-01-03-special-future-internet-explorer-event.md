We are glad to announce a very special Internet Explorer event. The event is co-organized, together with [Copenhagen .NET User Group](http://cnug.dk/), since it's also quite relevant for the Microsoft guys to know where IE is headed.

Normally we don't hear much about what's going on with IE, but we managed to get a guy who's working closely with the all-secret IE-team to come to Copenhagen.

Jeff Burtoft, [@boyofgreen](https://twitter.com/boyofgreen), HTML5 Evangelist at Microsoft, will be flying in from Seattle to give a presentation about the future of Internet Explorer.

This is the first time we someone close to the IE team in town, so start preparing your IE questions for Jeff :)

The event will take place at **28th January 2013, 19:00**, in the [Trustpilot office at Trommesalen 5, 3. sal, 1614](http://findvej.dk/Trommesalen5,1614).

We expect to have space for around **60 people**, and this to **go quick**, so please RSVP to the event in Lanyrd to get your spot.
