This workshop will teach you about serverless. We will see how we can deploy a website with serverless to both AWS and Google Cloud. We will talk about some of the challanges and how you solve it.

You will go home with knowledge that you can use, on how to do serverless afterwards!

We will meet at Founders House that has been so nice to host us.

You should bring you laptop as you will do everything yourself on that during the workshop!
