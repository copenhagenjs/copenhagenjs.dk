The next CopenhagenJS meetup will be on Thursday 2013-11-21 at 19:00. The event will be hosted by [d60](http://www.d60.dk/) at [Frode Jakobsens Plads 4, 2., 2720 Vanløse](http://goo.gl/maps/f4i7K).

We got 4 speakers for the event, but as always if you have a project you would like us to know about, some obscure problem you have solved in an interesting way, or just want to do a lightning talk to inspire some discussion, then let us know.
