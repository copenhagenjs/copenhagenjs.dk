Fashionably (?) late, we announce the December CopenhagenJS meta-meetup codename **GlöggJS**™ for this Thursday.
Let's meet for glögg, julehygge and talk about CopenhagenJS. 
What awesome things should we do in the next year? 

Also: If you have any christmas demos, bring them! If nothing else, Björn will show some snowflakes rendered with fonts and CSS3.

**November 17th 2011 at 19.00**.
