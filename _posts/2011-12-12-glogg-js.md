Fashionably (?) late, we announce the December CopenhagenJS meta-meetup codename **GlöggJS**™ for this Thursday.
Let's meet for glögg, julehygge and talk about CopenhagenJS. 
What awesome things should we do in the next year? 

Also: If you have any christmas demos (or other), bring them! 

**December 15th 2011 at 19.00**.
