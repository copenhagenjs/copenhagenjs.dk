<h3>Happy new year!</h3>

We are looking forward to bringing you another year of community meetups and enthusiastic talks about JavaScript, web technologies and other things that influence.

Last year we had [more meetups, more attendees and more talks](http://auchenberg.github.io/presentations/copenhagenjs-2013-status/#1) than any year before it. We will strive to repeat this trend in the coming year.

To help us get better and keep delivering interesting topics of discussion we hope that you will keep feeding us requests for topics, or maybe even give a talk about your favorite subject or a not so favorite subject that you want help with.

2014 is looking bright, for the web platform, for the community and for CopenhagenJS. We hope you will join us in celebrating and moving the web forward.

This years first meetup will be hosted by [Netmester](http://www.netmester.dk/).
