## CreativeJS with Seb Lee-Delisle and DemoDag

We are glad to announce a special "CreativeJS" event where we have [Seb Lee-Delisle](http://seb.ly/), also known as [@seb_ly](https://twitter.com/seb_ly) as our special guest speaker.

Seb will give a talk about how to use JavaScript "creatively", and to play on the creativity we have teamed up with [Demodag](http://demodag.org), who will be running interesting demos after the talk.
