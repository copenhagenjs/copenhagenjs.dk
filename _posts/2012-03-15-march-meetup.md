We are pleased to announce the March CopenhagenJS meetup.

**Thursday 2012-03-15 at 19.00.**

## Agenda

### Talks

* [@maclausen](https://twitter.com/#!/maclausen): Who put a Lisp in my browser? An introduction to ClojureScript, a Lisp that compiles to Javascript

We could still use a speaker or two, so if you have something to share, a cool project to show off, do drop us a note at <hello@copenhagenjs.dk> and tell us about your topic, and we will try to fit you in.

## Where?

The meetup is hosted by [Huubla](http://www.huubla.com/) in Copengagen.
Address: [Lygten 11, 2400, Copenhagen](http://maps.google.dk/maps?q=Lygten+11,+2400&hl=en&ie=UTF8&geocode=+&hnear=Lygten+11,+2400+K%C3%B8benhavn,+K%C3%B8benhavn+NV&t=h&z=16).


## RSVP

To get an indication of how many are attending, please visit the [Copenhagen JS March Lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2012/copenhagenjs-march/) and let us know if you're attending. Nothing is binding, we just need to know roughly how many that will attend.
