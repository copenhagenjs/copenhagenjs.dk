<h2>Welcome to our April meetup</h2>

The April CopenhagenJS meetup is hosted by [Foo Café](http://foocafe.org/).

<h3>Getting to the venue</h3>

Our host [Foo Café](http://foocafe.org/) is located in Media Evolution at [Stora Varvsgatan 6a in Malmö, Sweden](http://kartor.eniro.se/m/naxed). It's a short walk from Malmö Central Station.

<h3>Food and beverages</h3>

There will be pizza and drinks.

<h3>Help us find speakers</h3>

Do you know of some web technology topic that might be interesting to you? Maybe even to others?

Do you maybe even know of someone who might give a talk about that subject? Is that someone maybe you?

Why not give us a hand and [give us some speaker suggestions](http://copenhagenjs.dk/upcoming/). It will make the organization of CopenhagenJS easier and will keep the content interesting and diverse. This is a way that you can contribute to making our community great. We appreciate it!
