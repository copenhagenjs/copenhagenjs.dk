The next CopenhagenJS meetup will be on Thursday 2013-09-19 at 19:00. The event will be hosted by [Tradeshift](http://tradeshift.com/) at [Nørregade 36B, 3rd floor, 1165 Copenhagen K](http://goo.gl/maps/RDXRh).

We still need a couple of speakers for the event, so if you have a project you would like us to know about, some obscure problem you have solved in an interesting way, or just want to do a lightning talk to inspire some discussion, then let us know. You can either contact us through the [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/copenhagenjs/) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/copenhagenjs).
