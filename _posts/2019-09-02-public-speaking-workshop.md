# Public Speaking Workshop - Learn how to give your first tech talk

Hi ðŸ˜„, have you always wanted to give a talk at CopenhagenJS, but always felt short on the right idea, the courage or the inspiration? This meetup is all about helping you who haven't spoken at a meetup before. We will discuss topic ideas and storytelling, getting into the nitty gritty of what makes a good meetup talk.

Why:
Giving a talk is fun! You will share cool stuff with one of the nicest communities in Copenhagen :) Most likely, you'll also learn a lot of stuff while preparing the talk and meet cool new friends after the talk. If you feel like you want to give a talk, but might be holding back for any reason, this event is for you!

Who:
This is for anyone who might be interested in one day giving a talk. We strongly encourage beginners and people new to the field. Remember, no matter how novice you may feel, you care about a topic that people would be delighted to hear about.
