## September 18th – Yes, CopenhagenJS, but in Lund

We said earlier that there would be no September meetup. However we've made a special Lund event to wake up the JS community in Scania after the summer.

### Show and tell

The theme of this meetup is: Show us something you've worked on, or a tool you like.

Ideas, discussions, learnings, hacks and demoes are most welcome. No big slide decks are needed, just get up there and tell us what's on your mind.

The venue opens at 17:30 for food and drinks, the first talk starts at 18:30.
