## Welcome to the August 2015 Barbeque meetup

**Sunday 2. August: More tickets available!**

We are trying to shake things up a little bit, and together with our friends
from Billy.dk, are we arranging a cozy barbeque meetup, where we will sit in
the afternoon sun and enjoy a great evening and maybe drink a chill beer.

There will be a panel discussion about "heavy frameworks", where the audience
will provide their quetions to the experts.

There will be a panel discussion about frameworks. What is the future of those
and who are the audience? That is some of the quetions we will try to cover.

The people that will represent the different frameworks:

- Boyan Mihaylov [@bmihaylov](https://twitter.com/bmihaylov) - [Angular.js](https://angularjs.org/)
- Sebastian Seilund [@seilund](https://twitter.com/seilund) - [Ember](http://emberjs.com/)
- Lars Buur [@larsbuur](https://twitter.com/larsbuur) - [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/)
- Kasper Tidemann [@kaspertidemann](https://twitter.com/kaspertidemann) - [Mithril](https://lhorie.github.io/mithril/)


Because there is a limited amount of space, we need you to sign up for a ticket
which you can do very easily in the box underneath.

We are looking forward to see you!
