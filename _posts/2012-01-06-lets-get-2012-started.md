## Upcoming meetings

In order to allow you to plan your attendance, we've added all the meetings for the first months of the year to the [Lanyard](http://lanyrd.com/series/copenhagenjs/) series. On that page there are options for adding the dates to your iCal / Outlook / Google Calendar, as well as an RSS feed.

The first four meetings of the year will be:

* [2012-01-19 19:00](http://lanyrd.com/2012/copenhagenjs-january/), no venue yet
* [2012-02-16 19:00](http://lanyrd.com/2012/copenhagenjs-february/), no venue yet, we're looking to have a meetup in Malmö
* [2012-03-15 19:00](http://lanyrd.com/2012/copenhagenjs-march/), no venue yet
* [2012-04-19 19:00](http://lanyrd.com/2012/copenhagenjs-april/), no venue yet

### New venues?

We're trying to get a little variety in the location of the meetings. And for this we need your help.

If you know of a venue that

* can fit 25-35 people
* has a projector
* (and possibly even has wifi)
* has good connections to public transportation or central location (biking distance)
* are willing to host us

please drop us an email with details at <hello@copenhagenjs.dk>.

### Keep those talks and demos coming!

As always, we need your talks. If you have something you would like to share or a little demo of something you've built, drop us a line at <hello@copenhagenjs.dk>.

Also, if you have topics that you'd like to know more about, you can make [suggestions for talks in the Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/copenhagenjs).

## Competition!

We are running a raffle for a ticket to the [2012 Front Trends conference](http://2012.front-trends.com/), details are [posted in our Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/copenhagenjs/browse_thread/thread/29657152efd372a5).


### Sponsors!
If you have a dream of sponsoring local JavaScript enthusiasts, or know someone that does, we're happy to add sponsorship of a flight/accomodation to our competition.

Winner will be drawn at the end of next meeting, 2012-01-19.
