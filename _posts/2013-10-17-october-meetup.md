The next CopenhagenJS meetup will be on Thursday 2013-10-17 at 19:00. The event will be hosted by [KiggIt](http://kiggit.com/) at [The Orbit](http://symbion.dk/orbit/) at [Amagerfælledvej 56, 2300 København S](http://goo.gl/maps/RjFKM).

The danish startup [The Eye Tribe](http://theeyetribe.com), has been so kind to sponsor pizza's for us, and [KiggIt](http://kiggit.com/) is sponsoring drinks, so be there early to get some food!

We got 4 speakers for the event, but as always if you have a project you would like us to know about, some obscure problem you have solved in an interesting way, or just want to do a lightning talk to inspire some discussion, then let us know.
