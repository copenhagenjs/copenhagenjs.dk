CopenhagenJS is back! We are getting started again and the theme for our first meetup will be JavaScript performance. We have faster and faster machines but we also demand more, how do we combine those two things.

So come and join for an evening together with awesome people in the Copenhagen JavaScript community, everybody is welcome :) We are also bringing the infamous CopenhagenJS raffle, so don’t miss that!
