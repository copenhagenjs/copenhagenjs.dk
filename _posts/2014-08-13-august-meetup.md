## Welcome to our August meetup

The August CopenhagenJS meetup is hosted by [Eksponent](http://www.eksponent.com/).

### Tell us about your summer

We're looking for speakers, so come and tell us about your summer. Did you have any good ideas to work on? Did you get to a point where you'd like to share?

Ideas, discussions, learnings, hacks and demoes are most welcome. No big slide decks are needed, just get up there and tell us what's on your mind.

Ping us on [@copenhagenjs](https://twitter.com/copenhagenjs) and we'll add you to the schedule.
