<h2>Welcome to our March meetup</h2>

The february meetup will be hosted by [Blackwood Seven](http://blackwoodseven.com/).


<h3>Getting to the venue</h3>

We often have guests from outside of Copenhagen, and we of course hope that our swedish friends will join us yet again. The venue is placed in central Copenhagen, so there's many options. Use Google Maps to find your way.

<h3>Food and beverages</h3>

Our host Blackwood Seven has let us know that there will be pizza, drinks and snacks.


<h3>Help us find speakers</h3>

Do you know of some web technology topic that might be interesting to you? Maybe even to others?

Do you maybe even know of someone who might give a talk about that subject? Is that someone maybe you?

Why not give us a hand and [give us some speaker suggestions](http://copenhagenjs.dk/upcoming/). It will make the organization of CopenhagenJS easier and will keep the content interesting and diverse. This is a way that you can contribute to making our community great. We appreciate it!
