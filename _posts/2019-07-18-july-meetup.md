## About the speakers

**Zoey Zou:**

She came from a non-technical background -- a former buyer made to a developer, currently working in Pleo as frontend developer, as well as part-time meetup enthusiast. As someone who just had a career transform, she has her unique stories to tell -- for those who want to start something new or get some inspiration.

**Uri Godshtein:**

After doing GraphQL in production with small and large companies, Uri Goldshtein from The Guild would try to change the misinformation you might have about GraphQL with real production use cases and to show you how you can start using it today on any app.

**Bartlomiej Wietrak:**

Bart works as a fullstack developer at Maersk and heâ€™s gonna tell us how easy he as a .NET developer could start doing frontend development using just the platform api with LitElement, a framework agnostic approach.

## What is CopenhagenJS?

CopenhagenJs is a community group in Copenhagen for all JavaScript developers. We get together and share things we work on and really like. We talk about various technologies that we either use on a day to day basis or aspire to use.

## Can I present something at CopenhagenJS?

Definitely, CopenhagenJS is for and by the community, so you are more than welcome to talk about things that you find interesting and we will assist you with your speaking if you are new or have any difficulties. You can contact us with a private message or comment here on meetup.com, or on any social network where you can find us.
