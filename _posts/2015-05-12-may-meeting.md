This one is organised with very short notice. We're trying to get back to the monthly schedule.

[Falcon Social](http://www.falconsocial.com) has agreed to host us in their new offices on H.C. Andersens Boulevard 27, 1553 København V. More details to follow.

### Speakers wanted!

This is very short notice, we know.

Perhaps you have a talk you're working on and need a test audience, or maybe you already have a talk that you've given in another context?

### Lightning talks welcome!

Possible topics for your lightning talks

* demo something you built or something that excites you
* toolbox show and tell: share your favourite tools with the group (perhaps [@gausby](https://twitter.com/gausby) will once again enlighten us about Emacs)
