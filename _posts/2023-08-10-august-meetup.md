# CopenhagenJS August 2023 - Maersk

Hi everyone

Finally, the time has come, we are back again!

Corona has made us quiet but the community is desiring the fun gatherings for long. A lot has happened during the two year's time and I'm sure we all want to reconnect. We are working on reviving this lovely community meetup, so we have already lined up the meetups in the pipeline.

So come and join us and talk about JavaScript ðŸ˜€

## What is CopenhagenJS?

CopenhagenJS is a community group in Copenhagen for all JavaScript developers. We get together and share things we work on and really like. We talk about various technologies that we either use on a day-to-day basis or aspire to use.

## Can I present something at CopenhagenJS?

Definitely, CopenhagenJS is for and by the community, so you are more than welcome to talk about things that you find interesting and we will assist you with your speaking if you are new or have any difficulties. You can contact us with a private message or comment here on meetup.com, or on any social network where you can find us.
