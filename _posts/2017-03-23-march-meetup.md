It is time for the March edition of CopenhagenJS and TwentyThree has been so nice to offer to host it. We are always happy when the community reaches out. We are also looking for speakers for lightning talks, so don't be shy, let us know the topic, and get on stage! Or just come and meet others in the community and let's talk about JavaScript. :)
