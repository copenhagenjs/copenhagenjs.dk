### What is CopenhagenJS?

CopenhagenJs is a community group in Copenhagen for all JavaScript developers. We get together and share the things we work on and really like. We talk about various technologies that we either use on a day to day basis, or aspire to use.

### Can I present something at CopenhagenJS?

Definitely, CopenhagenJS is for and by the community, so you are more than welcome to talk about things that you find interesting. You can contact us with a private message or comment here on meetup.com, or on any social network where you can find us.
