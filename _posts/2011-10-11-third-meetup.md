## Agenda

* Peter Müller: One-color.js
* Björn Söderqvist: An interactive HDR viewer using Canvas
* Morgan Roderick: Closures, this, call and apply — an attempt at an explanation
* Ian Jørgensen: Javascript + robots, hell yes!!!

We could still use a speaker or two, so if you have something to share, a cool project to show off, do drop us a note at <hello@copenhagenjs.dk> and tell us about your topic, and we will try to fit you in.
