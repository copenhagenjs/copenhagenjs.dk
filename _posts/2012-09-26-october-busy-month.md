October 29th — MongoDB event
----------------------------------------------

##Ensuring High Availability for Real-time Analytics

Real time analytics is a compelling use case for MongoDB, but only if everything is up and running smoothly. We'll talk about how to set up and configure MongoDB to maintain high performance and redundancy. This will cover what to consider for high write throughput performance from hardware configuration through to the use of replica sets, multi-data centre deployments, monitoring and sharding to ensure your database is fast and stays online.

[**David Mytton**](http://twitter.com/davidmytton) is the founder of Server Density. He has been programming in PHP and Python for over 10 years, regularly speaks about MongoDB (including running the London MongoDB User Group), co-founded the Open Rights Group and can often be found cycling in London or drinking tea in Japan.

**When:** Monday October 29th, from 7.00 PM.

**Where:** This meetup is hosted by [Foo Café](http://www.foocafe.org/), Media Evolution City at Stora Varvsgatan 6a, Malmö

Price: **Free**
