### Special event: Get-a-logo

We have [Søren Siebuhr](http://sorensiebuhr.dk/) and [Niels Christian Konrad Nielsen](http://www.nckn.dk/) joining us for a special event. They are both very talented illustrators and designers. They will be doing a little creative workshop with us where they will help you sketch up some ideas for logos or illustrations for your projects.

So come along, and meet and throw around some ideas in this little creative session. If you need a logo or illustration, have some basic ideas and keywords thought up already that are loose enough to play around with, but good enough to get people started with some ideas.

Niels and Søren will do a short introduction at the beginning, going a bit more into details on what you can expect.
