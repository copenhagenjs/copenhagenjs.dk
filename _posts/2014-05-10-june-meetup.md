## Welcome to our June meetup 

The June CopenhagenJS meetup is hosted by [Conferize](http://www.conferize.com/).

### Help us find speakers

Do you know of some web technology topic that might be interesting to you? Maybe even to others?

Do you maybe even know of someone who might give a talk about that subject? Is that someone maybe you?

Why not give us a hand and [give us some speaker suggestions](http://copenhagenjs.dk/upcoming/). It will make the organization of CopenhagenJS easier and will keep the content interesting and diverse. This is a way that you can contribute to making our community great.
