This meetup will be a NodeSchool edition, so bring your laptop and come learn
something new.

NodeSchool is a concept built around small modules that each teaches you
something new. You can look at the website, but there is modules for everything
from learning basic javascript, to working with WebGL and Browserify.

There will be several people to help, so don't be afraid that you will be stuck!
