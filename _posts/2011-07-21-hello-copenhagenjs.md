Welcome to CopenhagenJS, a JavaScript community in and around Copenhagen, Denmark. We're a group of JavaScript enthusiasts that meet every month to share our knowledge and war stories with each other.

## When?

There will be a meetup on the third Thursday of every month at 19.00. Look to this site for announcements of speakers and venue.

Mark your calendar, the first meetup will be on <del>**August 18th 2011 at 19.00**</del> **August 24th 2011 at 19.00**, just a month from now.

## Where?

We're still busy organising and are talking with different people and have yet to settle on a venue. Once we have a good location, you'll be the first to know!

If your organisation would like to host CopenhagenJS for a meetup or to, please get in touch with us at <hello@copenhagenjs.dk>

## Call for speakers

If you have something you would like to share with the JavaScript community, why not give a talk at a meetup? You don't have to be Brendan Eich or Douglas Crockford to speak, all speakers are welcome.

Drop us a note at <hello@copenhagenjs.dk> and tell us about your topic, and we will try to fit you in.

We will try to coordinate and group related speakers together in the same meetup, to make it easier for the community members to decide if they want to attend a specific meetup.
